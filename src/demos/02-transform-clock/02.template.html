  <p>The current time is: <strong id="now"></strong></p>

  <p>In this demo, points are rotated around the z-axis using the engine's
    transform functions.</p>

  <p>The hour, minute, and second indicators are positioned by converting the
    parts of the current time to radians and using those values to calculate a
    rotation on each tick.</p>

  <p>The hour and minute hands are heavily quantized — this is because they are
    calculated by dividing hours by 12 and minutes by 60 before converting to
    rotation. We could fix this by converting them to seconds and dividing by
    (12×60) and (60×60) instead.</p>
